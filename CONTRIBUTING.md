# Contributing
This document outline some generals guidelines and considerations for anyone awesome enough to contribute.

## Coding Style
Please follow PEP-8 as much as is reasonable. Use good judgement.

## Open An Issue First
I take all offers of help with open arms. That doesn't mean that any new feature, fix, or enhancement will be included.
Let's talk about it first. I find it very frustrating to spend time on something only to have it ignored or rejected.
I want happy contributors, so lets make sure the work you want to do is likely to be accepted before you put in the
effort.

## Code Review
Every merge request will obviously be code reviewed. All feedback should be taken as constructive criticism. Feel free
to rebut any feedback. I'm interested in quality code, not stroking my ego or validating my opinions on how I think
things should be done.

## Unit Tests
Unit tests are awesome. I'm not likely to reject any pull requests without them, but I will definitely reject a merge
request if it breaks an existing test.

## My Promise To You
I have a full time job, family, and life. However, I will make every reasonable effort to address all discussions of new
features, bug fixes, and enhancements, as well as contributions in a timely and friendly manner.
